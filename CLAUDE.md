# CLAUDE.md — BlueOcean Automated Marketing Tool

How to build this project. This file holds the always-true rules and current status;
deep reference lives in the linked docs — read the relevant one before working in that area.

Automated B2B outreach: scrape leads → enrich (registry → Cowork → Snov.io) → Claude
assigns each lead to one or more campaigns → AI drafts 1 email per campaign → rep
reviews/approves → AWS SES (≤2×/week per lead) → reply-handler routes the decision tree.
Target markets: Singapore, Australia, US.

## Current Implementation Status

Repo is **`backend/`** (Bun + Hono) + **`frontend/`** (Next.js App Router) — **not** the
target monorepo. Do not treat `apps/`, `services/`, `shared/`, or `db/` as real paths;
they are target layout only (see `docs/roadmap.md`). Extend the existing `backend/` +
`frontend/` paths until a deliberate migration.

**Built:** all `/api/v1/*` routes; full Drizzle schema incl. `audit_log` +
`enrichment_records`; scrapers (Crawl4AI + Cheerio) + `runScrapeJob` with SSRF protection;
enrichment chain (registry → Cowork → Snov.io) persisting `enrichment_records`; drafting
(Haiku 4.5 parallel `messages.create`, one draft per lead/campaign, separate scoring pass) +
orchestrator with auto-schedule threshold (≥50 sends + confidence ≥70); sender (SES via
`SendRawEmailCommand`, warm-up cap, hard gates, follow-up send, `List-Unsubscribe` +
`List-Unsubscribe-Post` headers for Gmail/Yahoo compliance); all 7 cron workers (incl.
`mutation-runner` — auto-generates template variants via Thompson Sampling once 300+ sends,
`purge-old-records` — purges risk_flags for suppressed leads + writes to audit_log);
SNS/SES webhook signature verification; per-draft manual send (`POST /drafts/:id/send`);
suppression list view per campaign in the UI; frontend unsubscribe proxy
(`GET/POST /api/unsubscribe`) for RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe (port 3001 is firewalled —
all public links go through the frontend); in-memory rate limiting (100/min API, 10/min CSV
import, 50/min webhook); CSV-injection sanitization on lead import; admin right-to-deletion
(`POST /admin/leads/:id/erase`) with analytics-preserving de-identification; audit log
routes (`GET /admin/audit-log`, `GET /admin/audit-log/export`).

**Not built:** `campaign-assigner` (leads currently added to campaigns manually via UI/CSV);
monorepo migration; DB migrations not yet generated/applied; worker process separation
(workers run in-process with the API for now). JWT auth and env-driven CORS (`CORS_ORIGINS`)
are implemented. Details in `docs/roadmap.md`.

## Tech Stack

Bun · Hono · Next.js 15+ (RSC by default) · shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 · PostgreSQL + pgvector ·
Drizzle (close to raw SQL) · Crawl4AI (Cheerio fallback) · AWS SES · Claude Haiku 4.5 via
**Mastra agents** (`@mastra/core` + zod structured output; parallel `agent.generate` for
drafting/scoring/classification; raw `@anthropic-ai/sdk` Batch API for follow-ups only) ·
node-cron · AWS Lightsail (2GB / 2 vCPU, single instance).

## Coding Conventions

- **TypeScript only** — no plain JS; no `any` (use `unknown` + guards).
- **`async`/`await` only** — no `.then()` chains.
- **Drizzle** with explicit queries — never the raw `pg` client; no magic finders.
- **AI calls only via Mastra agents** defined in `backend/src/mastra/` (agents/, tools/, schemas/)
  and consumed through the services layer — never in route handlers or workers directly.
  Sole exception: the follow-up Batch API call in `services/drafting` (see AI Usage Rules).
- **Background work only in `workers/`** — no inline async jobs in HTTP handlers.
- **Secrets in `.env` only** — never log or interpolate them; `.env*` is gitignored.
- **Errors** — log with context; never swallow silently.
- **New vertical/market** — insert a `source_registry` row; `runScrapeJob` picks it up by vertical + geo.
- **Backend:** prefer Bun APIs; avoid Node-only APIs where a Bun alternative exists.
- **Frontend:** RSC by default, `"use client"` only when needed; shadcn via
  `npx shadcn@latest add <name>` (don't hand-edit `src/components/ui/`); use `oklch` theme
  tokens from `globals.css`, never hardcoded colors. Path alias `@/*` → `src/*`.
- The `Lead` interface lives in `backend/src/services/scrapers/cheerioScraper.ts` today;
  move to `shared/` at the monorepo migration.

## Hard Constraints (legal — non-negotiable)

1. Scrape only **publicly listed business contacts** — no personal/private data.
2. Respect **robots.txt** (exception: public government data with legal sign-off in the registry).
3. **Rate-limit scrapers:** 1 req / 2s; back off on 429; pause 24h on CAPTCHA.
4. **Max 500 records per domain per day** at the scraper level.
5. Check the **suppression list before every send**; include a **one-click unsubscribe** link in every email.
6. **Market legal flags:** SG → PDPA · AU → Privacy Act · US → CAN-SPAM.

## AI Usage Rules

- **Model:** Claude Haiku 4.5 everywhere, referenced via Mastra model-router strings
  (`anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`, pinned variant where needed) in `backend/src/mastra/model.ts`.
- **Structured output:** all agent responses are zod-validated via Mastra `structuredOutput`
  (schemas in `backend/src/mastra/schemas/`) — no regex JSON extraction.
- **Initial drafts:** `email-drafter` agent via parallel `agent.generate` (Anthropic
  `cacheControl` on the template system prompt) — 1 draft per (lead, campaign); template
  selected by Thompson Sampling; max **125 words**. Scoring is a **separate** second round of
  parallel calls through the `email-scorer` agent.
- **Follow-up content:** **hybrid exception** — raw `@anthropic-ai/sdk` **Batch API**
  (`messages.batches`, 50% pricing; Mastra has no batch wrapper), generated lazily in bulk by
  the daily `follow-up-sender` worker. Its scoring pass uses the Mastra scorer agent.
- **Classification:** `reply-classifier` agent — single `agent.generate`, no prompt caching.
- **Enrichment browsing:** `enrichment-browser` agent with `createTool()` browser tools
  (navigate/read_page/click_text/finish), `maxSteps: 12`, and a page-read eviction input
  processor to keep stale page dumps out of context.
- **Campaign assignment:** Claude Haiku 4.5 assigns each enriched lead to one or more
  campaigns with an `assignment_reason` (service not yet built).
- **Anti-hallucination:** approved campaign templates + lead fields only; no free-form
  product claims; each draft must follow its assigned campaign's objective.
- **Templates are immutable after creation** — iterate via the Duplicate action, not edits.

## What Not to Build

External CRM integrations · Redis / Bull / external job queues · Resend or Nodemailer
(**AWS SES only**) · student/parent-facing features · multi-tenant or white-label (internal tool only).
